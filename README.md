# House Price Prediction: Stability of Regression Models

This article examines the **stability** of linear and polynomial regression models in predicting house prices, focusing on analyzing **beta coefficients** to assess consistency and variance.

---

## Key Highlights

1. **Stability Analysis**
   - **Consistency**: Assesses whether beta coefficients remain stable across different datasets.
   - **Variance**: Evaluates the standard deviation of beta coefficients. High variance suggests potential instability or overfitting.

2. **Models Evaluated**
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression (Degrees 2, 3, and 4)

3. **Techniques**
   - **Bootstrapping**: Measures fluctuations in beta coefficients across samples.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Evaluates model performance consistency across data splits.

4. **Dataset**
   - Features include room count, age, crime rate, property tax, socioeconomic status, and house prices.
   - Dataset shape: `(399, 12)`

## Results

- **Low Variance (‚â§ 0.01)** in beta coefficients indicates stable models.
- **Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)** showed the best balance of performance and stability.

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that both **linear regression** and **polynomial regression (degree 2)** are effective for house price prediction. Among these, polynomial regression (degree 2) emerged as the most stable and reliable.
